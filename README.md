# TvIndexer
This native application can index movie and series files and show them in an overview.
This is only tested on a Mac, so don't take me accountable if something doesn't work on a Windows or Linux computer, but it might work straight out of the box.

## Installation
 - `git clone git@github.com:johman10/tvIndexer.git`
 - `npm install`
 - `npm start`

## Notice
Right now this app is still very, very, very unstable. It's more of an experiment than anthing else
